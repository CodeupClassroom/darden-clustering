    "# I have clusters...now what?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have created amazing clusters! Yay! \n",
    "At a minimum, you have a new piece of art. \n",
    "But what do you do now? How does this help you? Well (this answer will you surprise you), it depends. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![now_what.jpg](now_what.jpg)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview: what you can do with clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore your Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "I cluster multiple variables in order to be able to explore and understand my data better. As an example, in the Zillow dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cluster by bedrooms, bathrooms and square feet to understand the different groups of combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plot 2 dimensions, such at logerror and lot size, and color by cluster id to see multiple dimensions in a single plot and understand the interaction of all these variables on your target, logerror in this case, a bit better. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the clusters to run an anova to see if there is a significant difference in the log error among these groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. If there is a difference, what can we learn? What are the specs of the clusters with significantly higher or lower errors? \n",
    "\n",
    "________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turn your Clusters into Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "I create clusters that I then label so that I can build a model to predict which group an observation belongs in. For example, I want to classify H-E-B customers by types of items they shop for. But I don't know what the distinct groups are yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cluster based on something like average number of items per store department per visit. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Review clusters through exploration to create useful labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you have the clustering model fit, you can run predict on new data to identify which clusters new observations belong in OR, for a longer term solution, 3. Use supervised methods (regression/classification) and a training sample of your dataset (with features) with your target being labeled classes to create a model that predicts those classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After selecting the best model on train, test your model on the out-of-sample data that was already clustered (therefore it has labels) and evaluate. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run the model on all data to add labels to all existing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Take some random samples to manually verify and do a little exploration to verify the new labels are doing what you expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Each Cluster Separately\n",
    "\n",
    "I have created clusters of customers based on their consumption of hosting products and services. I have seen that the different clusters have different drivers of churn. I would like to build a unique model predicting churn for each cluster created. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cluster by services, products and monthly revenue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you have the clustering model fit, you can run predict on new data to identify which clusters new observations belong in. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use supervised methods (regression/classification) and a training sample of your dataset (with features + target variable) for each unique cluster to create a model that predicts your original target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "_____________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turn your Clusters into Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Use clusters to create new, more descriptive features. Could also reduce number of dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cluster by latitude, longitude and age to get \"area clusters\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cluster by home and lot size to get \"size clusters\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get descriptive stats of the value per sqft\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the standard deviation & median of the dollar per square foot for the cluster of the observation as new features (or other stats), or create dummy variables of the clusters. "

    "As I think about where it's difficult to predict housing prices, I think about areas where price and condition of homes vary drastically. This is generally in areas with older homes. So, how can we increase the information we have about those areas so that estimating the condition, and therefore the price, can be more accurate? There are so many ways to go about this, and who knows what will work best until we start trying them out. One idea I had was figure out a way to identify neighborhoods that are similar. Neighborhoods, in terms of the data available through the field `regionidneighborhood`, have many problems. The primary challenge is that so much of the data is missing. Secondly, there are many areas without defined neighborhoods. And the final point I'll mention (though there are more), is that there are so many neighborhoods that I wouldn't have to computing power to model each neighborhood separately! There is a way to do this, I'm sure, but that is going to wait until an iteration much in the future, and when it's possible to find the missing neighborhoods. \n",

    "So, all of that said, I want to find a way to cluster properties at a higher level than neighborhood and zip code in some cases, and can span both geographic areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we could predict the error using the variance or standard deviation of the property assessed values of similar neighborhoods? Large standard deviation leads to larger errors. \n",
    "If we cluster by latitude, longitude and age maybe we can get city segments that were developed closer in time to one another, at a level higher than zip code and neighborhood. And maybe it will help separate terrain a bit, like coast vs mountains. We can then get basic statistics of dollar/sqft and lot/sqft of those areas and use those statistics as features. So we will use the clusters to extract statistics that describe them, and use those stats as features. \n",
